# Spotify - Musicology
Fusing my passion for music and technology, this project explored data from 120,000+ songs spanning 6 decades. With a vast dataset of numeric and descriptive columns, I created visualizations to explore the ways in which musical taste has changed over time while noting the trends. Through graphic design choices, I conveyed the streaming platformâ€™s signature aesthetic.
